Eventually this will be a rust based language server (which is currently empty and unimplemented), but for now Iâ€™m just using the following sub-projects with a primitive implementation of syntax highlighting and autocomplete respectively:
- `vscode-subscript-markup-language`
- `vscode-subscript-autocomplete`
